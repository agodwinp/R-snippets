# R Snippets

This is a public repository for R code snippets that I'd like to share.

***

## Files

#### read_csv.R
- This is a few lines of code that will help you to read a .csv file into an R dataframe.
- This is always one of the first things that I used when working with data in R.

#### append_data.R
- This is a small piece of code that is very useful when working with temporal data.
- Using 'rbind', you can append data into 1 dataframe.

#### correlation_plot.R
- This code filters a dataframe into its necessary column, then it calculates a pearson R correlation matrix. Finally it plots a correlation plot.
- I have added some aesthetic additions that I like to use to make the plot clear, as well as the option to be able to choose a colour palette. 


## Usage

To use this code, either copy and paste the code from the file, or download the `read_csv.R` file locally and use the R code within your own notebooks or scripts.
