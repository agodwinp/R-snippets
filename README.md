# R Snippets

This is a public repository for R code snippets that I'd like to share.

#### read_csv.R
- This is a few lines of code that will help you to read a .csv file into an R dataframe.
- This is always one of the first things that I used when working with data in R.

To use this code, either copy and paste the code from the file, or download the `read_csv.R` file locally and use the R code within your own notebooks or scripts.
